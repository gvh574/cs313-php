    <h1>The Hall Family :)</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Greg Hall. This is my clan. I love them with all of my being. I consider myself lucky to have them a part of my life.</p>
    <p>I love to be physically active, mountain climbing, swimming, weight lifting, hunting, you name it, I love it. My passion is Personal Improvement, i love growing on a physical, mental, and spiritual level. When I can, I am privileged of helping others achieve similar goals.</p>
    <p>My wife, Jackie, is a full-time stay-at-home mother, a calling and responsibility which she thoroughly enjoys. She loves being active with me. She is a great sport and always is willing to try something new.</p>
    <p>Sawyer, my son, is a boss. He is now a year and a half old, and is wreaking havoc wherever he goes. He loves dogs, especially when they lick his hands and face. </p>
    <p>My wife and I have been married for a little more than 3 years now, and are looking forward to a life full of excitement.</p>
